      "description": "This course is for everyone who wants to learn applied mathematics on a college and university level! It is a complete course containing all relevant topics like Calculus, Algebra, Statistics & Stochastics. Advanced mathematics is relevant in many fields: Programming & IT, Engineering, Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Pharmacy, ...), Business & Economics. This course will teach you all you have to know in 24 hours. You are kindly invited to join this carefully prepared course in which we derive the following concepts from scratch. I will present examples and give you exercises (incl. solutions) for all topics. College-level mathematics (10 hours)Limits of functionsDerivatives & Integrals in 1 dimensionVectors in cartesian coordinatesStochastic & Probability distributionsUniversity-level mathematics (14 hours) Sequences & SeriesTaylor expansions Complex numbersDerivatives & Integrals in multiple dimensionsAlternative coordinate systemsDifferential equationsMatrix algebraFourier transforms & Delta distributionWhy me? My name is Börge Göbel and I am a postdoc working as a scientist in theoretical physics. I have refined my advisor skills as a tutor of Bachelor, Master and PhD students in theoretical physics and have other successful courses here on Udemy. I always had a passion for the mathematical side of science. Still today, I use the concepts of this course on a daily basis when I am programing on the PC or when I have to solve mathematical problems analytically on a sheet of paper. I hope you are excited and I kindly welcome you to our course! ",
